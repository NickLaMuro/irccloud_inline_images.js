irccloud_inline_images.js
=========================

Turns all links to a image in IRCCloud to a img tag

This is an expriment that I am working on currently and in no way expected that this is finished/perfect.  I am horrible at javascript and this is an excuse to get better at it.

Usage
-----

This is obviously not an officially supported plugin, but if you would like to try it out, add the js file in a bookmarklet and give it a shot!

(A more detailed README will be provided in the future)
