I am horrible at javascript and this is an excuse to get better at it.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not an officially supported plugin, but if you would like to try it out, add the js file in a bookmarklet and give it a shot!\r\n\r\nAdd the following as the URL for a bookmark to try it out:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njavascript: (function(){var jsCode = document.createElement('script');jsCode.setAttribute('src', 'https://raw.github.com/NickLaMuro/irccloud_inline_images.js/master/irccloud_inline_images.js');document.body.appendChild(jsCode);}());\r\n```\r\n\r\nWord of Note\r\n------------\r\nFor now, I know that IRCCloud uses jQuery, so I am currently not loading it in myself, but I might add a conditional check for it in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A more detailed README will be provided in the future)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
